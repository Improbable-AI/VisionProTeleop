# Happy Beam
Leverage an immersive space to create a fun game using ARKit.

In visionOS, you can create fun, dynamic games and apps using several different frameworks to create new kinds of spatial experiences: RealityKit, ARKit, SwiftUI, and Group Activities. This sample introduces Happy Beam, a game where you and your friends can hop on a FaceTime call and play together. To learn more about the features that this sample implements, see [Happy Beam](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/happybeam).

> Features in this sample that rely on ARKit or Group Activities only run on device, not in Simulator.
